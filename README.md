# Talent Loop - Assessment Form Update

## 🎉 Problem Fixed!

All issues have been resolved:

✅ ZIP code field added
✅ Address autocomplete with suggestions (NO API KEY NEEDED!)
✅ Auto-fill for City, State, ZIP, and Country
✅ Fixed navigation bug (no more repeating form)

---

## 📦 Files Included

1. **assessment.html** - Updated HTML with proper field order
2. **quiz.js** - Fixed JavaScript with address autocomplete
3. **address-autocomplete.css** - Styling for address suggestions dropdown

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Add CSS to Your Project

Add this line in the `<head>` section of your `assessment.html`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="address-autocomplete.css">
```

It should go right after your main `styles.css`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="address-autocomplete.css">
```

### Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub

Replace your existing files with these new ones:
- `assessment.html` → Replace old version
- `quiz.js` → Replace old version  
- `address-autocomplete.css` → New file (add it)

### Step 3: Test the Form

1. Go to your assessment page
2. Fill in personal information
3. When you type in the address field, you'll see suggestions appear
4. Click a suggestion to auto-fill all address fields
5. Click "Continue to Assessment" → Should show intro page
6. Click "Start Assessment" → Should show quiz (not repeat the form)

## 🌟 Address Autocomplete Features

### Uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)
- **100% FREE** - No API key required!
- **No billing** - No credit card needed!
- **No limits** for reasonable use
- Works worldwide

### How It Works
1. User types address (minimum 3 characters)
2. System searches OpenStreetMap database
3. Suggestions appear in dropdown
4. Click suggestion → auto-fills:
   - Street Address
   - City
   - State/Province
   - ZIP/Postal Code
   - Country

### Manual Override
All fields can still be edited manually if needed.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Address suggestions not appearing
**Solution:** Make sure you've added the `address-autocomplete.css` file and linked it in your HTML.

### Issue: CORS errors in browser console
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with Nominatim, but if it does, make sure you're testing on a live server (not file:// protocol).

### Issue: Form still repeating
**Solution:** Clear your browser cache and make sure you're using the new `quiz.js` file.

### Issue: Address fields not auto-filling
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. The Nominatim API might be temporarily slow - just wait a few seconds and try again.

## 🆚 Comparison: Google vs Nominatim

| Feature | Google Places API | Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Cost | Requires billing setup | **100% FREE** |
| API Key | Required | **Not needed** |
| Credit Card | Required | **Not needed** |
| Accuracy | Very high | Good (slightly less detailed) |
| Coverage | Worldwide | Worldwide |
| Rate Limits | Pay-per-use | Fair use policy |

## 💡 Future Upgrade Options

If you later want Google Places API (higher accuracy):

1. Get Google Cloud account
2. Add payment method
3. Enable Places API  
4. Get API key
5. Replace the address autocomplete code in `quiz.js`

But for now, the **Nominatim solution works great** and is completely free!
